# hello-world
Just another repository.

  I am Ugochi Uneke and I like to sing and dance and am a huge fan of music.  My favorite food is pizza and I love soccer even though I'm not really that good at it.  I have a younger brother, Kenny, and he is six years old.  My favorite subject in school is ELA and I would say that I'm pretty good at it.  My favorite animal is a dog (preferably a golden retreiver) and I love the colors red and blue.  My favorite singer is Demi Lovato because she makes very good music and has a super strong voice.  I want to be just like her someday and I am trying very hard to achieve that goal.  She is a very inspirational figure and worked hard to get to where she is now.  My favorite song right now Demi's most recent song "Tell Me You Love Me". I know all the words of almost all of her songs.
